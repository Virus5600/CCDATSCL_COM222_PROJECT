### PROPOSAL



1. Sleep Duration + Screen Time	+ Social Media Minutes	(6 hours prior to sleep)
2. Screen Time + Coffee/Tea Drink Intake + Mood Rating	(Entire Day)
3. Time Spent Commuting + Mood Rating			(Entire Day)



##### Social Media Usage Relation to Sleep and Overall Screen Time

 	With the advent of social media and how it keeps on optimizing itself to retain users in their platform, it is no surprise that some people may become addicted on that small dopamine hit whenever they use social media. In some cases, it becomes so negative that a person's sleep time gets affected, resulting to an indirect negative health impact. By tracking the social media usage 6 hours before sleep, along with the overall screen time, and a person's actual sleep, a relation may be seen that can be used in future studies.



##### Mood Based on Coffee/Tea/Energy Drink Intake and Screen Time

 	For any person who has to do or face codes and programs, caffeine related beverages become a must to keep them focused and awake. However, such beverage can also affect a person's mood, either positively or negatively, depending on how much they consume. This suggests that on some occasions, caffeinated beverages indirectly correlate to one's mood.



##### Effect of Commute Time on a Person's Mood

 	A commute takes time. Moreso if there's a heavy traffic. And in the local National Capital Region of the Philippines, traffic is everywhere and nearly all the time. Traffics creates, not only air pollution but also massive light and even sound pollution that may, aside from the annoyance and already negative inducing exhaustion, induce stress or negative mood swings. It is also important to note that the subject being tracked be identified whether they are the one driving or only a passenger as this may also impact the person's mood.
